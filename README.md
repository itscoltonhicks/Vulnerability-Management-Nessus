## Introduction

Here's what I did in this project:
- **Set Up a Lab Environment:** I created an analyst and vulnerable Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure. 
- **Use Nessus Vulnerability Scans:** I leveraged a popular tool called Nessus to scan the vulnerable VM for weaknesses
- **Follow the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle:** I followed a five-step process that closely aligns with [NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)](https://www.nist.gov/itl/smallbusinesscyber/nist-cybersecurity-framework-0), a highly respected set of guidelines for managing and mitigating cybersecurity risk. 

I ran an uncredentialed and credentialed scan on a vulnerable VM in my lab environment. Once everything was scanned accurately and efficiently, I remediated *critical* and *high* severity vulnerablities to improve the VMs security. I ran a final scan to verify all remediation efforts worked.

## Conclusion

I dived deep into Vulnerability Management with Nessus. I prepared a lab environment for vulnerability scanning by creating necessary Virtual Machines and doing off-domain configurations to connect Nessus to a vulnerable VM. I assessed the VM by scanning everything, created a basic report, then remediated the *critical* and *high* severity vulnerabilities. Finally, I verified my remediation efforts with a final scan.
